just completed
- flop, turn and river cards


next up
- set dealer (deal one card to each player, highest card dealt first wins, then clear cards from holeCards)
-- not sure how to evaluate the highest hand.
-- trying a random number generator and setting the player at the index to the dealer
- determine who won -> poker evaluator
- setting players turns (create a variable for player turn that sets the index)
- small/big blind
- player actions: check, bet/call, fold
- leave game
